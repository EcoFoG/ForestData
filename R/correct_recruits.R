#' @param data A data.frame containing a forest inventory in which each line corresponds to an individual's measurement for one census
#' @param dbh_min A scalar, integer or numeric, indicating the minimum DIAMETER at breast height at which trees are recorded, in centimeters. Defaults to 10 cm.
#' @param growth_limit A scalar, integer or numeric, indicating the maximum tolerated annual DIAMETER growth rate -in centimeters- over which a tree's growh is considered abnormal. Defaults to 5 cm, as set for Paracou inventories.
#' @param time_col A character indicating the name of the column containing census year information.
#' @param id_col A character indicating the name of the column containing individual tree's IDs
#' @param plot_col A character indicating the name of the column containing plot indices or names.
#' @param size_col A character indicating the name of the column containing tree size measurements -diameters or circumferences-.
#' @param status_col A character indicating the name of the column containing tree vital status - 0 for dead, 1 for alive, NA for unseen. No tree must appear with NA status before their first measurement.
#' @param measure_type A character indicating the size measurement type : "C" for circumference, "D" for diameter. Defaults to "C".
#' @param byplot A logical indicating whether there are several plots in the dataset. Defaults to TRUE
#' @param corrected_mortality A logical indicating whether the dataset was corrected for tree vital status errors beforehand. If FALSE, the correct_mortality function is called first with default parameters - see the function info section.
