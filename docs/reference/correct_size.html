    <p>Signification of the code_corr values (short):
- p_incr: punctual increase corrected by inter- or extrapolation
- p_decr: punctual decrease corrected by inter- or extrapolation
- def_incr_rp: definitive increase (or positive shift) corrected by realigning the most
recent series upon the previous one.
- def_decr_rp: definitive decrease (or negative shift) corrected by realigning the most
recent series upon the previous one.
- def_incr_rl: definitive increase (or positive shift) corrected by realigning the previous
series on the most recent
- def_decr_rl: definitive decrease (or negative shift) corrected by realigning the previous
series on the most recent</p>
<p>This is an adaptation from Camille Piponiot's original correction function.
This version is primarily designed to explicitely account for POM shifts. If
the POM were registered reliably, using it enables 1- to eliminate anomalies
due to POM shifts (typically, abnormal decreases in size without return to
"normal values") and 2- to detect cases that would not be detected with the
applied thresholds.</p>
<p>The optional argument "ignore_POM" triggers the version of the algorithm
designed for cases in which POM shifts have not been registered. This should
not be used if the information is available.</p>
<p>This function automates a quite simple yet efficient detection method based
on using meaningful thresholds to detect errors, and using linear inter- or
extrapolation from neighboring points to correct anomalous values or missing
measurements.</p>

<p>For example, the Paracou Disturbance Experiment database is corrected with
the following rules:</p>
<p>- An annual diameter growth that exceeds 5cm / year between two censuses is
considered abnormal.</p>
<p>- This applies to avery species except a handful of well-known pioneer trees
that sometimes exhibit explosive growth rushes (e.g. Cecropia obtusa) in the
first years following recruitment, and especially for disturbed forest plots.</p>
<p>- For these species, annual growths up to 8cm can be tolerated.</p>
<p>- An absolute diameter decrease of 2cm or more between two censuses is also
considered abnormal.</p>
<p>- Anomalies can be separated into two categories: punctual error and
permanent shift. The nuance relies on the existance of an event marking a
"return to normal size trajectory".</p>
<p>- A punctual error is an abnormal increase or decrease in size, that is
offset by a complementary decrease or increase in size. In certain cases,
this offsetting decrease of increase may not come immediately after the first
outlyer, for some reason (this has been observed in the base but not yet
explained). To separate efficiently shifts from punctual errors, the
algorithm search for the complementary diameter variation up to 2 censuses
after the first anomaly. The values of code_corr corresponding to punctual
increase or decrease are respectively p_incr and p_decr</p>
<p>- A shift is defined as an abnormal increase or decrease in diameter that is
not compensated by neighboring measurements.</p>
<p>- In most cases, shifts are negative and ared due to changes in Point Of
Measurement (POM). In Paracou, for hihly non-cylindric tree stems that cause
difficulties to accurately measure diameter or circumference, the size is
estimated and the information about this is reported in a "measurement code".
Estimations can cause positive as well as negative shifts in the Paracou
database.</p>
<p>- The changes in POM for the Paracou can be retrieved at least partially from
the "measurement code" field. This seems to be the most accurate way to
correct the dataset, even in the presence of unreported or falsely reported
POM changes, because it eliminates a great part of detectable and
undetectable negative shifts.</p>
<p>- Tree growth trajectories depend more on individual effect than species
identity. Moreover, due to the abundances distribution in this super-diverse
rainforest, species-specific growth patterns cannot be established in order
to be used for the corrections. Thus, the available growth values, for the
individuals to correct, are used in order to estimate growth or size
expectations.</p>
<p>- Growth is auto-correlated on the temporal dimension in many cases, thus not
all the measurement available for such individuals should be used to estimate
the corrected values. The 4 nearest values, if available and not abnormal,
are supposedly sufficient to estimate a "local mean growth rate".</p>
<p>Once detected, the correction is done according to the category of the
anomaly:</p>
<p>- for punctual increases or decreases, new values are computed according to
the 4 nearest non-NA and non-outlyer measurements (2 before the anomaly, 2
after),if existing. If values are available before and after the anomaly, the
corrected circumference.s or diameter.s are linearly interpolated with a
"local mean growth rate" computed from these values. If not, corrected values
are extrapolated.</p>
<p>- For shifts, one of the two "series" of measurement have to be re-aligned
upon the other. The criteria used to choose which series should be taken as a
reference depend on whether the POM are explicitely accounted for in the
correction, or not. If POM are not available, most of the shifts to correct
are supposed to be due to POM changes, leading to the choice to
systematically re-align the more recent series upon the older one in case of
negative shift. If POM is available, and is reliable enough to allow
eliminating most POM shifts, remaining negative shift have roughly the same
chances to correspond to e.g. erroneous estimation on non-cylindric stems. In
this case, the series having the highest number of values is supposed to be
more reliable than the other, and if both series are of same length, the most
recent is picked.</p>
<p>- The codes corresponding to shifts are composed of a first part that describes
the shift (def_incr or def_decr for definitive increase or decrease respectively)
and a suffix that describes the realignment (_rp or _rl for realigned with previous
or last series, respectively)</p>
