\title{Compute Annual Mortality Rates in Forest Inventories}
\usage{
compute_mortality(data, status_col = "status_corr",
  time_col = "CensusYear", id_col = "idTree",
  dead_confirmation_censuses = 2, byplot = TRUE, plot_col = "Plot",
  corrected = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing a time-series tree-wise forest inventory -i.e. every line is a single tree measurement for a single year.}

\item{status_col}{Character. The name of the column containing tree vital status - 0=dead; 1=alive.}

\item{time_col}{Character. The name of the column containing census year}

\item{id_col}{Character. The name of the column containing trees unique ids}

\item{dead_confirmation_censuses}{Integer, defaults to 2. This is the number of censuses needed to state that a tree is considered dead, if unseen. In Paracou, we use the rule-of-thumb that if a tree is unseen twice, its probability to be actually dead is close to 1. The choice of this value involves that trees unseen during the X-1 last inventories can not be corrected for death, and thus mortality rates should not be calculated for these censuses.}

\item{byplot}{Logical. If there are several plots in your dataset, the correction is performed by plot, in case these would not be censuses the same years or with the same frequencies one another.}

\item{plot_col}{Character. The name of the column containing the plots indices.}

\item{corrected}{Logical. Indicates whether the dataset has been corrected for errors in tree life status; if not it will be corrected beforehand using correct_alive function}
}
\value{
A data.frame with absolute and annual mortality rates by plot and census interval.
