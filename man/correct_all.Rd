}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame, containing forest inventories in the form of a
long-format time series - one line corresponds to a measurement for one
individual at a given census time.}

\item{id_col}{character, name of the column containing trees unique IDs.}

\item{time_col}{character, name of the column containing census years.}

\item{status_col}{character, name of the column corresponding to tree status:
0/FALSE for dead, 1/TRUE for alive.}

\item{plot_col}{character, name of the column containing plot indices or
names.}

\item{byplot}{logical, indicating whether the function has to process the
data by plot (TRUE)or for the whole dataset (FALSE).}

\item{dead_confirmation_censuses}{integer, defaults to 2: number of
consecutive censuses for which a tree is unseen that are needed to consider
the tree as dead. NB: for the trees unseen during the
dead_confirmation_censuses -1 last inventories, the status cannot be
corrected, thus mortality rates should not be calculated for these
censuses.}

\item{use_size}{character, defaults to FALSE. Optional argument specifying
whether to use measurement column (circumference or diameter) to create a
vital status field  in case it does not already exist. See Details.}

\item{invariant_columns}{character vector, containing the name of the columns
for which value remain constant for a given tree (for example species name
or coordinates). When a row is added by the function correct_alive, values
for invariant columns are taken from the value for other censuses. Defaults
to null}

\item{size_col}{character, name of the column corresponding to tree size
(circumference or diameter) measurements .}

\item{species_col}{character, name of th column containing full species names
(or other taxonomic identification)}

\item{POM_col}{character, name of the column corresponding the Point Of
Measurement (POM).}

\item{measure_type}{character, partially matching “Circumference” or
“Diameter”, indicating what is the type of the measurements.}

\item{positive_growth_threshold}{positive numeric or integer, threshold over
which an annual DIAMETER growth is considered abnormal (in cm). Defaults to
5 cm.}

\item{negative_growth_threshold}{negative numeric or integer, threshold under
which an absolute DIAMETER difference  is considered abnormal. To be given
in centimeters. Defaults to -2 cm. Note that this threshold is applied
between two consecutive censuses, regardless of the time between them, as
it assumes that a tree diameter cannot decrease more than this value, even
over a long period.}

\item{default_POM}{scalar numeric, default POM used in the dataset, in the
same unit as the POM. When the value in POM_col is different from
default_POM, the corrected size is given at default_POM  . It defaults to
1.3 meters-according to current practice of measurement of diameter at
breast height (DBH).}

\item{pioneers}{character vector containing full species name (or other
taxonomic identification)for which a specific positive growth threshold
(used for instance for fast growing species for which the threshold to
detect an abnormal growth is high).}

\item{pioneers_treshold}{Positive DIAMETER growth limit to apply to pioneer
species (specified in 'pioneers'), similar to . Expressed in centimeters.
Defaults to 7.5 cm}

\item{dbh_min}{scalar integer or numeric, indicating the minimum DIAMETER (in
centimeters) at the default measurement height from which trees are
recorded. Defaults to 10 cm.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with additional columns: status_corr and size_corr for
  corrected tree vital status and size, code_corr for correction tag and
  types.
}
\description{
correct_all performs corrections for tree life status, overgrown recruits
cases, size measurement errors and POM changes, by calling correct_alive,
correct_size and correct_recruits in this order.
