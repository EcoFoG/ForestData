\usage{
.correct_status_plotlevel(data_plot, dead_confirmation_censuses, use_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_plot}{data.frame, a single-plot forest inventory which names correspond to the format set in correct_alive, which is on the long format for census years - one line is one tree measured at one census. It already contains a field named status_corr, which as this point is just a copy of the raw, uncorrected status field}

\item{dead_confirmation_censuses}{numeric scalar, the number of "unsighting" censuses from which we state that the tree is almost certainly dead. In Paracou, we set it to 2 considered censusing rythm and the experience of the censusing crew}

\item{use_size}{Character, but defaults to FALSE. Optional argument specifying that circumference or diameter must be used to create the vital status field. If your data already contains a field indicating whether the tree is dead -0 or FALSE- or alive -1 or TRUE-, let it to its default value. If you use this option, make sure beforehand that only live trees are measured - non-NA size - in your dataset's protocol.}
}
\value{
a data.frame containing the inputted plot-level data with trees' corrected life statuses. 1 = alive, 0 = dead. NAs indicate that the tree was unseen and cannot be considered yet. The output does not necessarily have the same number of lines as the input. Lines are added when the tree is unseen then seen alive again, with all columns being NA except trees' id, plot, census year and corrected status. Useless lines -with NA status before first sight alive, or after death- are suppressed.
