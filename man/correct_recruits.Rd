\title{Correct Overgrown Recruits in Forest Inventories}
\usage{
correct_recruits(data, dbh_min = 10, positive_growth_threshold = 5,
  time_col = "CensusYear", id_col = "idTree", plot_col = "Plot",
  size_col = "Circ", status_col = "status_corr",
  measure_type = "circumference", byplot = TRUE,
  correct_status = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame, containing forest inventories in the form of a long-format time series - one line corresponds to a measurement for one individual at a given census time.}

\item{dbh_min}{scalar integer or numeric, indicating the minimum DIAMETER (in centimeters) at the default measurement height from which trees are recorded. Defaults to 10 cm.}

\item{positive_growth_threshold}{positive numeric or integer, threshold over which an annual DIAMETER growth is considered abnormal (in cm). Defaults to 5 cm.}

\item{time_col}{character, name of the column containing census years.}

\item{id_col}{character, name of the column containing trees unique IDs.}

\item{plot_col}{character, name of the column containing plot indices or names.}

\item{size_col}{character, name of the column corresponding to tree size (circumference or diameter) measurements .}

\item{status_col}{character, name of the column corresponding to tree status: 0/FALSE for dead, 1/TRUE for alive.}

\item{measure_type}{character, partially matching “Circumference” or “Diameter”, indicating what is the type of the measurements.}

\item{byplot}{logical, indicating whether the function has to process the data by plot (TRUE)or for the whole dataset (FALSE).}
}
\value{
A corrected data.frame
}
\description{
correct recruits spots individuals that have first been unseen during previous censuses but were already over the minimum counting dbh, and provides a correction that is useful to compute biomass estimates.
