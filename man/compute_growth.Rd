\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame, containing forest inventories in the form of a
long-format time series - one line corresponds to a measurement for one
individual at a given census time.}

\item{size_col}{character, name of the column corresponding to tree size
(circumference or diameter) measurements .}

\item{measure_type}{character, partially matching “Circumference” or
“Diameter”, indicating what is the type of the measurements.}

\item{status_col}{character, name of the column corresponding to tree status:
0/FALSE for dead, 1/TRUE for alive.}

\item{id_col}{character, name of the column containing trees unique IDs.}

\item{time_col}{character, name of the column containing census years.}

\item{what_output}{character, one of 'annual' or 'absolute'. Defines if the output growth rates must be annualised growth rates or absolute between-census deltas (respectively).}

\item{aggregate}{logical, defining if the growthrates must be aggregated (TRUE) according to specified variables (argument 'by') with calculated values 'stat' and quantiles ('percentiles'); or returned for each individual (FALSE).}

\item{by}{character vector, names of the grouping variables used to aggregate values.}

\item{stat}{character, one of the following: 'mean','sum','median'. Statistics used if values are aggregated.}

\item{percentiles}{integer vector between 0 and 100. Percentiles are calculated if values are aggegated.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments for advanced use. ask_stat: logical, defaults to TRUE, if set to FALSE, try directly to use the specified 'stat' for aggregation without checking it -thus, not failproof-.verbose: logical, defaults to TRUE, if set to FALSE or equivalent, show less messages.}
}
\value{
Either the input data.frame with individual-level calculated growth rates, or a data.frame with grouping variables and required statistics.
