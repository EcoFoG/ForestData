\item{data_plot}{A data.frame containing a subset of forest inventory corresponding to one plot, formatted as in "correct_recruits".}

\item{dbh_min}{A scalar, integer or numeric, indicating the minimum DIAMETER at breast height at which trees are recorded, in centimeters.}

\item{diameter_growth_limit}{A scalar, integer or numeric, indicating the maximum tolerated annual DIAMETER growth rate -in centimeters- over which a tree's growh is considered abnormal.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing the corrected plot
}
