\title{Correct Tree Size Measurements}
\usage{
correct_size(data, size_col, time_col, status_col, id_col, POM_col,
  positive_growth_threshold, negative_growth_threshold, default_POM)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data.frame, no default. Forest inventory in the form of a long-format time series - one line is a measure for one individual during one census time.}

\item{size_col}{Character. The name of the column containing tree size measurements - diameter or circumference at breast height}

\item{time_col}{Character. The name of the column containing census year}

\item{status_col}{Character. The name of the column containing tree vital status - 0=dead; 1=alive.}

\item{id_col}{Character. The name of the column containing trees unique ids}

\item{POM_col}{Character. The name of the column containing trees POM}

\item{positive_growth_threshold}{Numeric. Upper threshold over which an annual DIAMETER growth is considered abnormal. Defaults to 5 cm.}

\item{negative_growth_threshold}{Numeric. Lower threshold under which a negative annual DIAMETER growth is considered abnormal. Defaults to -2 cm.}

\item{default_POM}{Numeric. POM normally used in the forest inventory- defaults to the internationa convention of breast height, 1.3}
}
\value{
The same data.frame with two additional columns: size_cor, containing corrected tree size measurements, and code_corr, containing codes that tag both corrections locations and type.
}
\description{
This function provides corrections for tree size measurements in Forest Inventories.
POM are to be given as an input, and POM shifts are accounted for by adjusting the after-shifts value
translating the points to offest the observed size loss by: after_shift_size_corrected = after_shift_size_original + difference_before_after + expected_growth.
