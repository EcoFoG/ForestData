\usage{
display_rates(mortality = NULL, recruitment = NULL, rates = NULL,
  type = "line", time_col = "time", color_col = "plot",
  faceting = FALSE,
  title = "Annual mortality and recruitment rates in function of census intervals.",
  subtitle = NULL, save_graph = FALSE, device = "png",
  path_save = file.path("ForestGraphs",
  paste0("annual_mortality_recruitment_", type, ".png")),

}
\arguments{
\item{mortality}{data.frame, output of \code{compute_mortality}.}

\item{recruitment}{data.frame, output of \code{compute_recruitment}.}

\item{rates}{data.frame, output of compute_rates or merged outputs of compute_mortality and compute_recruitment.}

\item{type}{character, partially matching one of the following: "line",
"histogram", "bar", "smooth". For the moment, only "line" is implemented,
being the most relevant in this case. Corresponds to the type of graph to
be done, for examples see \code{ggplot2} examples for \code{geom_line},
\code{geom_histogram}, \code{geom_bar} and \code{geom_smooth}.}

\item{time_col}{Character, name of the column corresponding to census time}

\item{color_col}{Character, name of the colomn used to define lines' colors,
defaults to "Plot".}

\item{faceting}{Character, name of the variable used for faceting -see after-
but defaults to FALSE i.e. no faceting. NB: faceting refers to using a
grouping variable to layout multiple plots, each corresponding to a
category of the grouping variable. See details for a pratical explanation.
The scales are free on the x axis: t correspond to several groups not
necessarily having the same censusing temporal resolution; but are bound on
the y-axis: the values are displayed on the same scale for comparison
purposes.}

\item{title}{Character,title of the graph.}

\item{subtitle}{Character, subtitle of the graph. Defaults to \code{NULL}}

\item{save_graph}{Logical, indicates whether the graph must be saved or not.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, please set the above described
arguments in an appropriate way.}

\item{device}{Relevant if \code{save_graph=TRUE}. Character, the graphical
device to be used to save the graph.}

\item{path_save}{Relevant if \code{save_graph=TRUE}. Character, a path
indicating in which FOLDER the graph has to be saved.}

\item{name}{Relevant if \code{save_graph=TRUE}. Character, the name of the
folder containing the graph. It can be followd by the extension
corresponding to the device - avoid .jpg for the jpeg device, use .jpeg
instead. If the extension is missing, it is automatically added according
to the selected device.}

\item{create_folder}{Relevant if \code{save_graph=TRUE}. Logical, indicated
whether the folders in the given path must be created in case they do not
exist yet, or not.}

\item{overwrite}{Relevant if \code{save_graph=TRUE}. Logical, indicating
whether a file already existing under the same name must be overwritten, or
kept. In the second case, the function aborts with an explicit error
message.}

\item{...}{Additionnal arguments to be passed to inernals, and ggplot2
utilities.}

\description{
display_rates take either a rates rates table -obtained with
\code{compute_rates}- or two tables -mortality and recruitment, obtained with
the corresponding \code{compute_*} functions-, and returns a nice graph
according to user-specified parameters. This function requires the
installation of the package \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot2}}.

\details{
\strong{\emph{About displaying multiple variables and avoiding
unreadability:}}

Imagine a mortality and recruitment \code{table} computed for 3 species in 4
different plots, for 20 censuses, with corresponding columns named
\code{"Plot"}, \code{"Species"} and \code{"time"}. Then, imagine displaying
it using \code{type = 'line'}. All this information can be displayed in one
call of display_rates, with different possible combinations:

- One graph per forest plot, with the color of each line segregating species,
and the linetype segregating mortality and recruitement rates. This can be
done with the arguments \code{color_col = "Species"} and  \code{faceting =
"Plot"}, with the argument \code{linetype} not specified, thus internally
defaulted.

- One graph per species, with the color of each line segregating plots, and
the linetype segregating mortality and recruitement rates. The  function call
has thus the arguments \code{color_col = "Species"} and  \code{faceting =
"Plot"} again without speciying \code{linetype}.

Mortality and recruitment are defaultly segregated with different line types
-e.g. full and dotted-, but this variable type can also be used to facet,
yielding one plot for mortality rates and another for recruitment: for
example, using \code{linetype  = "Species"}, \code{color_col = "Plot"}
\code{faceting = "rate"}.

In this case, using the linetype additionnal argument to display another
variable must be done with some caution: if there are too many categories in
this other variable, they would hardly -if not impossibly- be visually
segregated by line types.

\strong{\emph{Detail of the additionnal arguments}}

The arguments corresponding to \code{...} here encompass a limited number of
parameters that are internally set if not specified. These parameters are
passed to different sub-functions. Here is the detailed list of these
arguments.

\code{x.axis.name} and \code{y.axis.name} are the axis labels to be passed to
\code{ggplot2::xlab} and \code{ggplot2::ylab}

\code{transparence} is the scalar value of \code{alpha} in
\code{ggplot2::geom_*} functions.

\code{linewidth} is the scalar value of \code{size} in
\code{gplot2::geom_line} -to be used with \code{type='line'}.

Note that a variable's name -in the dataset- can also be provided to make
vary these parameters according to the data. In such case, these arguments
are passed to \code{ggplot2::aes} instead.

\code{linetype} is originally set to differenciate the rates -mortality and
recruitment- for use with \code{type = 'line'}. It means that
\code{linetype="rate"} -a name set internally as the data is reshaped to long
format before displaying. This argument is originally passed to
\code{ggplot2::aes_string}. In case the user wants to e.g. facet rates into
two separate plots and use a constant \code{linetype} instead, they just have
to specify e.g. \code{linetype=1} and it will be passed to \code{geom_line}
instead.

\code{x.text.angle} and \code{y.text.angle} is the angle of the axis ticks'
labels. It is set to be 0 -horizontal- for y and 90 -vertical- for x, because
it helps reading census times by avoiding overlaps. These are passed to
\code{gplot2::element_text} within \code{ggplot2::theme}
